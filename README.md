# AutoCorrecting

Hello! Welcome to my autocorrector in python.
To begin, please install these two libraries below

# pip install pyspellchecker
# pip install python-Levenshtein

Run the program and in the terminal you will see:
# Enter a sentence: 
There you will enter your desired sentance, be it mispelled or even correct type it in!
Next, you'll enter your sentance and the following will pop up
## Corrected sentence:
## Number of corrected words:
## Total edit distance: 
 Here, my program gives you the corrected sentance
 Then, how many words it corrected
 and lastly the total of edits it had to make inbetween.
